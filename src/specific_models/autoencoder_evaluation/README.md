# Scripts used for evaluating the impact of different dataset separation methods on autoencoder performence when performing anomaly detection.

## Datasets used:

* BoT-IoT 5%
* Bezerra2018
* CICIDS

## Note:

No pipelines are used for model evaluation. No cross-validation, the data is processed manually after splitting the dataset. **If pipelines are used and cross-validation is performed, the file will have a CV suffix.**
